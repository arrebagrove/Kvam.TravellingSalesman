An implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Travelling salesman problem</a> based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithms</a>.

Starting with a random route, the algorithm applies mutations and permutations on the best current routes to generate new generations. By basing new routes on the previous generation's best routes, the algorithm gradually improves its results.
